<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Track Geometry Car Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Measurement</li><li>Non-contact Measurement</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Track Geometry Car market is divided into two primary types: contact measurement and non-contact measurement. Contact measurement systems utilize physical sensors that directly engage with the track, ensuring precise data capture of geometric parameters like alignment, gauge, and cant. In contrast, non-contact measurement systems employ technologies such as lasers or optical sensors, allowing for data collection without physical contact, which enhances speed and minimizes track disruption. Both methods are crucial for ensuring safety and efficiency in railway operations.</p></p>
