<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peritoneal Dialysis Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD)</li><li>Automated Peritoneal Dialysis (APD)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The peritoneal dialysis devices market is primarily categorized into two types: Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) and Automated Peritoneal Dialysis (APD). CAPD involves manual fluid exchange performed by patients throughout the day, providing flexibility and independence. In contrast, APD utilizes a machine to automate the dialysis process, typically performed at night, allowing patients to rest while treatment occurs. Both methods enable effective waste removal for patients with kidney failure, though they cater to different lifestyle preferences and clinical needs.</p></p>
